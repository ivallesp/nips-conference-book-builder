# NIPS 2018 conference book (unofficial)
This repository contains the NIPS 2018 conference books together with the code to generate them in MarkDown. In the original website the conference book has not been uploaded yet. I created this repository to **scrap the NIPS website and generate a conference book**, with all the details of each conference (title, authors, dates, type of event and description). That way, for me, is easier to review. I converted the markdown files to pdf just in case somebody needs the pdf version. Enjoy it!

## Getting started
If you want to run the code to scrap the NIPS database and/or extend it, please, follow the subsequent steps.
1. Install the following dependencies
  - Python 3.6
  - tqdm
  - beautifulsoup
  - numpy
2. Run from the root of the repository the following command `python main.py`

## Contribution and next steps
If you want to correct a bug, extend or improve the outputs or make any modification, you are kindly invited to perform a pull request! It will be reviewed and accepted as soon as possible.

A possible important next step would be to fix the latex formulas so that they are correctly displayed.
